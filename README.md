# It's the Tribute Project!
This is the final project for FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design certificate, representing time spent learning HTML, CSS, and the principles of responsive and accessible web design. Relevant user stories and details can be found here: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-tribute-page

In short, the project is simple, lightly responsive, and readable by screen readers. It's not meant to be particularly pretty or special!
